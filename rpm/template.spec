%description
rqt_py_common provides common functionality for rqt plugins written in Python.
Despite no plugin is provided, this package is part of the rqt_common_plugins
repository to keep refactoring generic functionality from these common plugins
into this package as easy as possible. Functionality included in this package
should cover generic ROS concepts and should not introduce any special
dependencies beside &quot;ros_base&quot;.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
