%description
This rqt plugin succeeds former dynamic_reconfigure's GUI (reconfigure_gui), and
provides the way to view and edit the parameters that are accessible via
dynamic_reconfigure. (12/27/2012) In the future, arbitrary parameters that are
not associated with any nodes (which are not handled by dynamic_reconfigure)
might become handled. However, currently as the name indicates, this pkg solely
is dependent on dynamic_reconfigure that allows access to only those params
latched to nodes.
