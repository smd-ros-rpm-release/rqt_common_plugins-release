%description
rqt_common_plugins metapackage provides ROS backend graphical tools suite that
can be used on/off of robot runtime. To run any rqt plugins, just type in a
single command &quot;rqt&quot;, then select any plugins you want from the GUI
that launches afterwards. rqt consists of three following metapackages: rqt -
core modules of rqt (ROS GUI) framework. rqt plugin developers barely needs to
pay attention to this metapackage. rqt_common_plugins (you're here!)
rqt_robot_plugins - rqt plugins that are particularly used with robots during
their runtime.
